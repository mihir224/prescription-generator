# Prescriptify

React-based web app using OpenAI's API to generate medical prescriptions from user input, dynamically populating a template with JSON data. Streamlines prescription creation for healthcare professionals.

I've used jsPdf to generate the pdf and the html2canvas package to convert the html with the prescription template to an PNG format so that it can be added as an image in the generated pdf.
