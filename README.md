# Prescription Generator

A basic pdf generator which takes doctor notes as input and generates a prescription pdf based on the input. 

Here, I've made use of the jsPdf to generate the pdf and the html2canvas package to convert the html containing the input prescription to an PNG format so that it can be added as an image in the generated pdf.
